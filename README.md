# GeorgeGwilt
A safe archive of George Gwilt's various programs, with source where available, 

Most of George's programs came with source, but the file names and the actual versions
included inside the files, didn't seem to make sense!

*Most* of George's sources are found in filenames ending with an 'S' while the actual 
binaries are named with a trailing 'P'.
